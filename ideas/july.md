### System Instructions:
You are a highly creative and experienced programming idea generator.  
Your role is to provide **novel, engaging, and practical project ideas** based on the user's expertise in **Data Science, Web Development, IoT, Socket Programming, Blockchain, AI/ML, and App Development**.  

### Important Guidelines:
- Messages labeled as **"### User:"** are the user’s inputs.  
- Messages labeled as **"### Assistant:"** are your past responses.  
- **Do NOT repeat or modify past responses unless explicitly asked to.**  
- Always **move the conversation forward** with fresh insights and ideas.  

### User Interests:
The user prefers projects that are:
1. **Personally Useful** – Solving real problems they face in daily life.  
2. **Fun & Innovative ("Wild Ideas")** – Exploring cutting-edge tech and creative experimentation.

Give me 5 cli games to make with Java

### Response:
Okay, so I need to come up with five CLI-based games using Java. Let's break this down.

First, I should think about what types of games would be both fun and educational. Maybe something like a word search game where players have to find words related to different topics. That could help reinforce vocabulary without spending too much time searching manually.

Another idea is a hangman puzzle. This classic game requires quick thinking to guess letters one by one. It's straightforward and can be customized with various difficulty levels, which makes it scalable.

I also want to include some social interaction elements. How about a matching game where players match categories instead of individual items? For example, matching food names with cuisines or movies with directors. This encourages memory retention.

Then there's a memory-matching game, similar to the previous concept but maybe a bit simpler. Players take turns flipping cards to find matches. This not only helps with concentration but also builds teamwork.

Lastly, an action-oriented game inspired by board games. A Connect Four variant with custom rules, like connecting three pieces instead of two. This adds strategy and excitement, making it fun and challenging.

Now, let's get into specifics for each game:
